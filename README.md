Inventory and sales management app for online store

Arrasa Vendas is a Android app used as a mobile front-end for inventory and sales management of the
online make-up store ArrasaAmiga ( arrasaamiga.com.br ) . The business no longer exists, but through
his lifetime as the sales channel were Instagram, facebook, whatsapp and our website, this Android 
app was crucial for the business strategy allowing their sellers to register new sales and 
consulting inventory in real time over the internet.

The main functionalities includes
  - Store's products inventory management. The data in the app is in sync with the website's server MySQL database
  - Cash flow management. Every single sale or expenses are tracked by this app. The goal is use this data to keep 
    a eye on the store financial health 
  - Delivery management: The store delivered local orders through motorcycle courier everyday. As local sales were registered,
  the customer chose the delivery hour and date, place to deliver the goods,form of payment and the motorcycle courier had all
  information in order to do his job
  - Store's products image management: Some clients contacted sellers through Whatsapp in order to request more information and
  images from our products. As it was a lot of work for a seller to get all images from a product of the site and send 
  to a client we decided to automate this job: The seller selected a product from the catalog and the app was in charge 
  of download the product's images and send to the client using Whatsapp's Intent capability on Android.
  - Sales commission calculation: The app proccess all successful sales and reports seller's performance 
  and comission from the current month
